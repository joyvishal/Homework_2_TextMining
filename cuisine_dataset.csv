Your sauce recipe has a lot of starch for the amount of liquid. It's a wonder that you got any sauce at all. Also that's a lot of oyster sauce. Typical ratios are one part oyster sauce to three parts soy sauce.,CHINESE

They can be used to make a pretty decent sauce for a pork tenderloin. Or they can be used reduced down and used to make a BBQ sauce.,AMERICAN
"Given the state of research on diet, it's hard to say how much you should care about the recipe using butter vs olive oil, but either way, the quantity sounds excessive. Partly because congealed butter on top sounds unappetizing and wasteful. I'd suggest reducing both the butter and sugar (although you still want it to coat the sweet potatoes, to protect it from drying out too much), but cooking it longer and lower at first, possibly covered, to help bring out the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes and make them soft enough. Roasting sweet potatoes slowly can get you an almost candylike result without any added sugar, whereas cooking them quickly in the microwave always gives a blander, starchier result. That said, this sounds like a holiday recipe, and it's best not to try to force holiday recipes to change.",MEXICAN

"In my opinion, unless your Vietnamese Grandma is gonna cook all day, the best way to eat pho is at a restaurant (hint: They all do takeout and its just as good, they serve all the components separately, and you make it yourself, get a large and its two meals). Making real pho broth takes many hours and many ingredients, its best done in large batches due to the cost and effort, but for a home cook, that sucks. Other than the broth, getting the noodles, veggies, meats/tendon/meatballs/tripe, and sauces is easy, but without the real broth its not quite the same However, one workaround... chicken pho! Just use low sodium chicken broth as your base, and put together your pho ingredients to your liking, and have it that way. Yes chicken pho is a normal traditional dish too, though personally, i do prefer the beef.",CHINESE

"I tried so many all-butter chocolate chip cookie recipes because I assumed butter was just a superior ingredient to use, because, like you said, it gives better flavor. But I was just not pleased with the texture of any of them. Finally I had some cookies that my MIL made and they were delicious, the exact texture I wanted. I asked her for the recipe and sure enough, a butter/shortening mix.",AMERICAN
"I feel like this question is more ""what staples do i buy"". I would suggest buying 1 new 'pantry' item every time you make a dish. If i had to 'limit' my pantry, the must haves would be.. roughly in this order.. Salt, cayenne, cumin, flour, baking powder, thyme, Italian seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, brown/white sugar, whole canned tomatoes, chicken broth, beef consomme... That should give you a jump start on making tacos, french onion soup, spaghetti, most importantly several different variations of the same ""meat in pan, sauce and veggies, starch on side"" one pan meals, chicken wings, and lots of baked goods",ITALIAN
"If I'm making gravy by deglazing the pan with a broth of some sort or some wine, I'll make a ""slurry"" of a couple of teaspoons of oil mixed with a couple of teaspoons of flour and mix that in, a spoon at a time. That thickens everything nicely without making glue. It works better than using water. Basically, if I'm making a sauce using a hot roux, i'll use a cold liquid. If I'm making a sauce with a hot liquid, I'll use a cold roux (also works well for thickening stews). That rule has never failed me.",FRENCH
Just make a garlic+olive oil+butter sauce and you will love any veggie in the world :D,ITALIAN
"Red beans and rice. White rice, kidney beans, celery, bell pepper, and onions are all cheap. Besides that all you need is salt and you can buy packets of ham seasoning if you don’t want to spend money on meat. You can make very large portions that last a while. Bell pepper is the most expensive thing on here and you could not include it if you want. Edit: and you need some cooking oil but I’m assuming you have that!",AMERICAN

"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.",ITALIAN

"Pasta salad. Cook a bag of macaroni, small shells, spirals, whatever type of small pasta. Let it cool and stir in some chopped tomatoes, chopped basil, chopped black olives, maybe some corn, cucumber, or capsicum if it strikes your fancy, and like 1 tablespoon of balsamic or white vinegar and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. (Depending on how much pasta you used, add more oil and vinegar in that 2 oil:1 vinegar ratio until you get the taste and consistency you like, but not too much. Recipes are a bit variable on how much oil they specify.) It lasts pretty well for at least a few days in the fridge, though the basil will quickly lose its freshness, is on the cheap side, and is great in a plastic container for lunch.",ITALIAN
Try gnudi and corn tortillas.,MEXICAN
"Yea flying with Eagles was pretty corny and now I understand why you might think I need your pity. Profession was supposed to be professed but I was on a train and listening to an audio book, so it slipped past me. My point was that if you're cooking quick and dirty, at home, bachelor style; microwaved chicken from frozen is damn good. I discovered it when I was trying to defrost it and ended up cooking it. Once I refined the process, I found the results easily comparable to anything done on the stove top, excepting for sear but we're talking about chicken here, and we're trying to not make a production out of the production, so searing isn't in context. If you're hell-bent on getting that crust, once it's cooked, get out the blow torch and put a sear on it. I've been in more than one restaurant that used this trick to get things looking nice... Anyways, have a nice day, next time your hungover and all the dishes are dirty, try microwaving some frozen chicken. If you wanna get fancy, throw some bacon and butter into the mix with some spice. One bowl, less then ten minutes. It's ugly but it taste damn good.",AMERICAN

"Souffles are dead easy in my experience. The only real trick is having the dish and the diner at the table at the same time, which is solved by artichokes first. The souffle can be assembled an hour or so before baking.

If not, then another dish would be a better choice.",FRENCH

Also you are offering 7 dishes but only one meat (chicken) dish, and no seafood; I reduce to 5 (3 salad/pasta, 2 mains) and maybe add a simple dessert. Another tip is hand made chocolates to accompany coffee, which are trivially easy - melt chocolate &amp; pour into a mold. Can be done days before and guests will think you are a genius. Hint: buy marked down goods at the supermarket, you will get to try all sorts of things out of your comfort zone.",INDIAN

You'd better be prepared to make a lot of quick runs to the store with no notice, for when he discovers that you threw out something that he needs to use *right now* because he had no idea he no longer owns a bottle of spanish paprika.

"> There is almost no benefit to making your own sauce, buy a nice fresh jarred one and use that. Making your own tomato sauce from canned tomatoes, basil, oregano, and olive oil is ridiculously simple and quick.
