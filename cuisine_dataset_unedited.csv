"Given the state of research on diet, it's hard to say how much you should care about the recipe using butter vs olive oil, but either way, the quantity sounds excessive. Partly because congealed butter on top sounds unappetizing and wasteful. I'd suggest reducing both the butter and sugar (although you still want it to coat the sweet potatoes, to protect it from drying out too much), but cooking it longer and lower at first, possibly covered, to help bring out the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes and make them soft enough. Roasting sweet potatoes slowly can get you an almost candylike result without any added sugar, whereas cooking them quickly in the microwave always gives a blander, starchier result.

Just remember that spending a bit more on food is worth it in the long run if you can avoid developing diabetes. How restricted are you going to go with carbs? I mean, if you're going keto, then your options will be severely limitted to pretty much meat, cheese, berries, and non-starchy vegetables, but if you can afford 100+ g carbs per day then starchy vegetables, fruits, and whole grains become easier to include. The latter foods are much cheaper than the former, and you'll spend less. Source: I did keto for a few months. My food bills rose about 40%. I'm less restrictive with carbs now.",homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC,144350900,-2015310303,INDIAN,INDIAN,FRENCH,FRENCH,JAPANESE,JAPANESE,ITALIAN,ITALIAN,MEXICAN,MEXICAN,CHINESE,CHINESE,AMERICAN,AMERICAN,choice,single,reject,1710901710,2024-03-19_22-06-52,2024-03-19_22-06-52,

"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.",homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC,204160723,-366237386,INDIAN,INDIAN,FRENCH,FRENCH,JAPANESE,JAPANESE,ITALIAN,ITALIAN,MEXICAN,MEXICAN,CHINESE,CHINESE,AMERICAN,AMERICAN,choice,single,accept,1710901825,2024-03-19_22-06-52,2024-03-19_22-06-52,ITALIAN

Once I refined the process, I found the results easily comparable to anything done on the stove top, excepting for sear but we're talking about chicken here, and we're trying to not make a production out of the production, so searing isn't in context. If you're hell-bent on getting that crust, once it's cooked, get out the blow torch and put a sear on it. I've been in more than one restaurant that used this trick to get things looking nice... Anyways, have a nice day, next time your hungover and all the dishes are dirty, try microwaving some frozen chicken. If you wanna get fancy, throw some bacon and butter into the mix with some spice.

"I love cooking and have been doing it for twenty years. I've made some really good dishes over the years, and some not so good as well. My problem is that I could never quite reproduce the taste each time I made it without using a recipe. My wife would ask me to make a dish that was really good last time, and it would turn out different. Not bad, mind you, but not the same as she was expecting. Recently, I've been delving more into good blogs and online recipes, and I have to say I'm hitting it out of the park! I still occasionally make changes to dishes that I'm more familiar with, since I'm pretty comfortable working with different flavors and cooking methods. FYI, just because you follow a recipe doesn't mean you're not a good cook. You still have to understand and do things right. On the flip side, I've known many people (my mom in particular; don't tell her I said so) who could follow the exact same recipe and end up with something really bad. Some things that I've been making and getting rave reviews lately on are nearly foolproof however, especially using a slow cooker. I've been trying to find the most creative and delicious slow cooker ethnic meals that I can think of. I take the complements because I found the recipe, bought the ingredients, followed the directions and ended up with way better food for my family and friends than they would have made themselves. I've had people say they've never had that particular food outside of a restaurant, or that they didn't know you could make that in a Crock Pot.

Culturally, there's much less isolation. It's only a matter of time before one of them writes a blog or a book, or does a series of youtube videos. We've already seen some pretty good youtube clips on British gravies, CTM is very close. Pizzerias used to be run by Italian Americans who were very isolated and who guarded their recipes aggressively, but, eventually, that knowledge got leaked, and, now, we know just about everything there is to know about pizza. Indian restaurant food isn't that far behind. The biggest barrier, by a very very wide margin, is the common misconception that one of these seemingly countless recipes out there actually hits the mark. It's apathy that's holding us back.

"Congrats on your move! I think I've got a couple of tips :) Here's a video for 4 different ways to prepare your eggs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIZNHQC01K4 And a ton of different egg recipes to spark your creativity: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/egg-recipes and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/best-egg-recipes/ As for having a college budget, I recommend making lots of frittatas or quiches. Those can last you over a couple days, and you can put a variety of ingredients in there depending on what you have! Bacon, ham, cold cuts, veggies, potatoes, make your own flavor combos: https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/frittata-recipes/ When you want to start cooking with wine, I highly recommend using red wine for your meats, and white wine for chicken or fish. You can also tackle that vanilla extract any time you want, it can be pretty cheap and adds loads of flavor. One small bottle of that stuff will last you a long time. You can make yourself pancakes, or even muffins and scones to last you over the course of the week. You could even do something like a quick bread, like banana bread, blueberry bread, chocolate chip bread: http://www.midwestliving.com/food/breakfast/sweet-bread-treats/?page=5, they'd be great with some coffee or tea for breakfast. When it comes to cheap ingredients, I recommend Struggle Meals by Tastemade on Youtube! You cold also make chili or cold pasta salads which can be cheap and very versatile depending on what's available or on sale at your local store. Chili: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/best-chili-recipes-gallery Cold pasta salads: https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g2365/pasta-salad-recipes/ You could also make tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, fajitas, and quesadillas if you're into that type of cuisine! They're all very versatile: https://tasty.co/recipe/weekday-meal-prep-chicken-burrito-bowls and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/quesadilla-recipes-quick-dinner/ Asian inspired meals could be fun too, like teriyaki chicken, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, all of these can be served with a side of jasmine rice.

"Ugh. Story time. Couple years back, I ended up going to a town up north for an event on short notice. A friend of my wife's was staying with her mom at that point, and they had a couple extra bedrooms so they invited us to stay instead of trying to find a hotel. To repay the kindness, I offered to cook a nice dinner, figuring that they haven't had someone cook for them in quite a while and wanting to repay them for hosting us. Finding dishes and utensils wasn't so bad. However, I pulled out a hot dish of chicken parm from the oven, and unfortunately I picked an oven mitt that didn't have adequate protection. And the oven was more than a few steps from the table. And all the countertops were cold granite, no trivets in sight. The only way to not launch the hot af dish, or put it on a cold granite counter (likely shattering the dish and ruining the chicken due to thermal shock) was to grab it with my other bare hand. That burn sucked ass, because the reason I was in town was a music festival and I was there to perform. Fortunately most of the work on my instrument was with my right hand, and the burn was on my left. But it still sucked ass.",homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC,-1956410628,-1867537940,INDIAN,INDIAN,FRENCH,FRENCH,JAPANESE,JAPANESE,ITALIAN,ITALIAN,MEXICAN,MEXICAN,CHINESE,CHINESE,AMERICAN,AMERICAN,choice,single,reject,1710904010,2024-03-19_22-06-52,2024-03-19_22-06-52,
