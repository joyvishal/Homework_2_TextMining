{"text":"At CIA we began marinara (red sauce) with bacon; surprisingly, it makes a huge difference. &amp;#x200B; **However**, if your vegan or vegetarian, I have come up with what I've dubbed \"Fakon.\" Start with vegetable oil or olive oil to cover the bottom of your pot (don't waste extra virgin olive oil at this level); add 2 level Tbl Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp Liquid Smoke (I uses Stubb's Mesquite), 3-6 drops of Toasted Sesame Oil. Fakon smells and tastes just like bacon in this application. It will give your marinara a base background to build upon. The quantities are only to give you a ratio of Paprika to Liquid Smoke to Sesame Oil. Be careful not to use too much sesame oil, as it will give your food an Asian flavor if there's too high a percentage of it. &amp;#x200B; Once you've got the oil and fakon going, add in peeled, crushed garlic and get a little color on it ... slowly. Once the garlic has become translucent, add in the mirepoix (2pts chopped onion, 1pt chopped celery, 1pt chopped carrots) onions first, and get a little color on the the onions (deeper color = deeper flavor). Once the garlic and onions have a little color on them, add in the celery and carrots. I also like to add a layer of diced portabella mushrooms, nicely browned in butter to the mix. It adds another layer or umami complexity to the sauce. &amp;#x200B; If you're using fresh tomatoes, make sure you concass\u00e9 the tomatoes first. Concass\u00e9 gets rid of the skin and the seeds and their gel-like goop. Skins are bitter, and the seeds' gel sort of waters down the flavor of your sauce. Also, if anyone you know has issues with diverticulitis, they can't eat seeds or skin. It may seem like a pain, but it's worth it if you want a high quality sauce. &amp;#x200B; Then simmer slowly. Add equal amounts of salt and sugar (dark brown sugar will add more flavor). Actually, the amount of sugar depends on the acidity of your tomatoes; You're looking for balance. Add the balance of your herbs and spices to taste. The only two herbs I never use dried in this sauce are basil and parsley; always use fresh for both, because drying changes them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-1369956382,"_task_hash":-282035065,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"IRRELEVANT","text":"IRRELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"accept":["RELEVANT"],"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709850943,"_annotator_id":"evaluation_dataset_jay-jay","_session_id":"evaluation_dataset_jay-jay"}
