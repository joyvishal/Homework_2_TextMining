I'd suggest reducing both the butter and sugar (although you still want it to coat the sweet potatoes, to protect it from drying out too much), but cooking it longer and lower at first, possibly covered, to help bring out the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes and make them soft enough. Roasting sweet potatoes slowly can get you an almost candylike result without any added sugar, whereas cooking them quickly in the microwave always gives a blander, starchier result.

That said, if your carb sources come from processed foods like store bought chips, breads, and cereal, then buying fresh, low carb ingredients may not cost more. Just remember that spending a bit more on food is worth it in the long run if you can avoid developing diabetes. How restricted are you going to go with carbs? I mean, if you're going keto, then your options will be severely limitted to pretty much meat, cheese, berries, and non-starchy vegetables, but if you can afford 100+ g carbs per day then starchy vegetables, fruits, and whole grains become easier to include.

{"text":"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":204160723,"_task_hash":-366237386,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"IRRELEVANT","text":"IRRELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709872713,"_annotator_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi","_session_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi"}

{"text":"I love cooking and have been doing it for twenty years. I've made some really good dishes over the years, and some not so good as well. My problem is that I could never quite reproduce the taste each time I made it without using a recipe. My wife would ask me to make a dish that was really good last time, and it would turn out different. Not bad, mind you, but not the same as she was expecting. Recently, I've been delving more into good blogs and online recipes, and I have to say I'm hitting it out of the park! I still occasionally make changes to dishes that I'm more familiar with, since I'm pretty comfortable working with different flavors and cooking methods. FYI, just because you follow a recipe doesn't mean you're not a good cook. You still have to understand and do things right. On the flip side, I've known many people (my mom in particular; don't tell her I said so) who could follow the exact same recipe and end up with something really bad. Some things that I've been making and getting rave reviews lately on are nearly foolproof however, especially using a slow cooker. I've been trying to find the most creative and delicious slow cooker ethnic meals that I can think of. I take the complements because I found the recipe, bought the ingredients, followed the directions and ended up with way better food for my family and friends than they would have made themselves. I've had people say they've never had that particular food outside of a restaurant, or that they didn't know you could make that in a Crock Pot. I've had some people say it's some of the best food they've ever had! Following recipes helps you discover all the culinary treasures, many that you'd miss if you just made up your own dishes all the time. Do yourself a favor and accept the compliment.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-724671400,"_task_hash":-920707719,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"IRRELEVANT","text":"IRRELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709872941,"_annotator_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi","_session_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi"}

{"text":"Congrats on your move! I think I've got a couple of tips :) Here's a video for 4 different ways to prepare your eggs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIZNHQC01K4 And a ton of different egg recipes to spark your creativity: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/egg-recipes and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/best-egg-recipes/ As for having a college budget, I recommend making lots of frittatas or quiches. Those can last you over a couple days, and you can put a variety of ingredients in there depending on what you have! Bacon, ham, cold cuts, veggies, potatoes, make your own flavor combos: https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/frittata-recipes/ When you want to start cooking with wine, I highly recommend using red wine for your meats, and white wine for chicken or fish. You can also tackle that vanilla extract any time you want, it can be pretty cheap and adds loads of flavor. One small bottle of that stuff will last you a long time. You can make yourself pancakes, or even muffins and scones to last you over the course of the week. You could even do something like a quick bread, like banana bread, blueberry bread, chocolate chip bread: http://www.midwestliving.com/food/breakfast/sweet-bread-treats/?page=5, they'd be great with some coffee or tea for breakfast. When it comes to cheap ingredients, I recommend Struggle Meals by Tastemade on Youtube! You cold also make chili or cold pasta salads which can be cheap and very versatile depending on what's available or on sale at your local store. Chili: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/best-chili-recipes-gallery Cold pasta salads: https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g2365/pasta-salad-recipes/ You could also make tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, fajitas, and quesadillas if you're into that type of cuisine! They're all very versatile: https://tasty.co/recipe/weekday-meal-prep-chicken-burrito-bowls and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/quesadilla-recipes-quick-dinner/ Asian inspired meals could be fun too, like teriyaki chicken, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, all of these can be served with a side of jasmine rice.

A friend of my wife's was staying with her mom at that point, and they had a couple extra bedrooms so they invited us to stay instead of trying to find a hotel. To repay the kindness, I offered to cook a nice dinner, figuring that they haven't had someone cook for them in quite a while and wanting to repay them for hosting us. Finding dishes and utensils wasn't so bad. However, I pulled out a hot dish of chicken parm from the oven, and unfortunately I picked an oven mitt that didn't have adequate protection. And the oven was more than a few steps from the table. And all the countertops were cold granite, no trivets in sight. The only way to not launch the hot af dish, or put it on a cold granite counter (likely shattering the dish and ruining the chicken due to thermal shock) was to grab it with my other bare hand. That burn sucked ass, because the reason I was in town was a music festival and I was there to perform. Fortunately most of the work on my instrument was with my right hand, and the burn was on my left.

Turn it on and drizzle about a cup of olive oil in. Homemade mayo is always better. If I order sushi I mix that with wasabi, wasabi mayo is proof God exists. sriacha for deliciousness with fried stuff The juice from chipotle for Mexican flare Relish for tartar Buttermilk for a ranch dip Anchovy and mustard for Caesar dressing Another great base is basic yogurt Mix with garlic and cucumber for tzasiki Lemon and Herbs for just herb dip Capers and onions goes good on fish Horseradish too Ketchup and horse radish is cocktail sauce Mayo and ketchup is thousand island Mustard and mayo is just a good dip Then there's the mother sauces, most of them start with a roux: A roux is made by heating equal parts fat and flour. You leave it until the flour has been cooked. It should smell like toasted bread and take on a blonde appearance. Some recipes call for darker roux A bechamel is what happens when you add milk to your roux A veloute is what happens when you add a add a white stock like fish or chicken to your roux An espagnol is what happens when you add brown stock like beef or duck to your roux (it's also called gravy) A tomate is what happens when you add tomato pur\u00e9e to your roux Then there's emulsifications, mayo falls into this category. When something has been emulsified it means they are mixed until they cannot separate. You usually need an emulsifier, this keeps everything neat and tidy. A common emulsifier is egg yolk Hollandaise is what happens when you emulsify melted butter with air. Think of it as mayo. But instead of oil you're using butter. Put a stick of butter in a double boiler, add an egg yolk and get to whipping. It's amazing. You can easily make mustard by grinding seeds up in a coffee grinder, adding red wine vinegar and salt and letting it sit Ketchup is strained tomato sauce, sugar, and red wine vinegar Hot sauce fermented chili peppers. Add fresh hot peppers to a jar that's CLEAN, cover with salt. Cover and leave in a warm dark area, shaking it every other day, opening it to burp it every now and then. Pur\u00e9e and strain. You can make a basic Mexican sauce with dried peppers, I use ancho and guajillo.

{"text":"IMO, the key is browning. If you throw in the oven without browning, you're missing out on the potential chix flavor. Raw olive oil is healthy. Once cooked, as far as I understand it, it looses its positive properties and can actually be harmful - I've heard people claim this but I am having trouble finding any source. Perhaps a biologist or chemist can opine. Nevertheless, take any pan over high heat and let it get hot, but not so hot that it will scald olive oil in seconds. Also, preheat oven to 350, say. Season raw chicken directly. put in a tablespoon or so of OO and once shimmering, place chix in pan. Don't touch. Let brown. The chicken will release itself, even from a non-stick pan. Once it's cooked about 1/2 way through, just take the pan (assuming it's oven safe) and put the whole thing in the oven for 5-10 minutes.

{"text":"They're not hard to cook, they're hard to cook perfectly. EDIT: cooking at home and cooking in a restaurant are about as far apart as taking your car to the store and driving in an F1 race. That, and the contestants on Hell's Kitchen are not the most shining examples of skilled professionals. When they cook the dish, they've got a dozen other things not only to think about, but also to do. Not just that, but when the dish is fired, they've got to match it up with upwards of 4-5 other dishes going out. This creates problems and challenges. You have to communicate with other people who aren't extremely skilled at what they're doing, and rely on them to let you know how long it's taking them to complete their task. It's really not as simple as sticking it in the oven and taking it out when the timer beeps. It's more like - I've got 5 wellington on order, 4 fired, going with 3 lamb, just coming off my station. Now, I've also got to make sure that they finish exectly when 4 lobster, 6 scollop, and a vegetarian risotto. Oh, wait, in the middle of all of this, someone sent back a lamb I have to refire not because it was mistemped, but because it's a tv show and they scripted someone to send back food to test me on how I can adapt. And that isn't even a difficult rush for your normal everyday neighborhood bistro. So, while you may sit there and say to yourself, \"How difficult is that? I could do what they're doing.\" I assure you, the standard they're being asked to meet is one that far exceeds yours, and the sheer number of tasks they have to perform in the course of 20 minutes of a good rush in the kitchen exceeds the amount of tasks you perform in the average week in yours.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":1959247711,"_task_hash":-1688644142,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"IRRELEVANT","text":"IRRELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709876503,"_annotator_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi","_session_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi"}

{"text":"My gf and I prepare a casserole or large dish every Sunday night, which serves as dinner and makes 3-4 lunches for both of us throughout the week. We also freeze some and rotate them, so we might eat the same one 2-3 times and take one from a previous week. We generally rotate around: * Lentil dahl or variation of some lentil dish. * Lasagna or some other pasta dish. Sometimes with meat, sometimes without. Rigatoni with italian sausage is one of my favs. * Mexican casserole with beans, corn, cheese., or some combo of tex-mex inspired food that does large portions like tons of fajitas (which freeze great), or a big enchilada casserole. * Big batch of stew or curry with lots of vegetables. Basically anything that doesn't take too long to make a big batch of, is healthy and is lunchable. Of course we'll make food with leftovers sometimes during the week, but I find it better to eat a salad or sandwich (which aren't great to keep overnight) at night and take my big meal at lunch. Furthermore, IMO, it's not really efficient to spend time cooking the night before if you're not planning on making a meal out of it. If you're gonna be in the kitchen, might as well eat, right? :) Extend that, and the best way to spend your kitchen time is to prep a lot of food in advance. If you really need a quick meal to prepare as a last minute thing to make a lunch, like the other commenters said, sandwiches are the quickest. But the feeling of popping out a beautiful, warm dish at lunch that keeps you filled for the next 4-5+ hours is more pleasant.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":2126465709,"_task_hash":1487898505,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"IRRELEVANT","text":"IRRELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709876565,"_annotator_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi","_session_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi"}

It also allows me to \"sight\" my cuts- by looking down the spine of my blade toward the edge, I can align it so that I know I'm cutting perfectly downward. The wide blade is also good for using the \"claw grip\" because you can always rest your knuckles against it. With a less wide blade, sometimes your knuckles can slip above the spine of the knife if you are cutting something tall. I also feel like it's safer.

{"text":"You mentioned pulled pork, so this jumped to mind. for an amazing NC-style pulled pork BBQ from hog to plate, make sure to mop the pork with the vinegar BBQ sauce. Even if you can't do a whole hog and are instead smoking (preferred) or roasting a pork butt or shoulder, open the door every so often, remove any outer shell of cooked meat and baste with some sauce. As for the sauce, every NC BBQ master has their own recipe, but if you really want that sauce to pop, add some red pepper flakes and bring the concoction to a boil. That helps the flavors to blend. Alternately, you can just let the sauce sit overnight to blend a little. I'm from NC and now live in VA. We tried a new BBQ place in MD, so of course, I tried some of their pulled pork and sauce. the pork was pretty good (hickory smoked), but I almost wept at the sauce: apple cider vinegar, a little sugar, some salt, and pre-ground black pepper. It was so bland and just tasted like pepper. edit: One more trick for pecan pie. I use 2.5 cups of pecan halves per pie, which mounds up nicely with the custard base. I also use a basting brush to spread chocolate liqueur on the crust. A former co-worker shunned my pie at a company potluck, saying he hated pecan pies. After the potluck, he comes to my office carrying an empty pie plate. He had eaten over half of it, even the crust, which he usually just leaves on the plate.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-1831410238,"_task_hash":-1585784458,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"IRRELEVANT","text":"IRRELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709877027,"_annotator_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi","_session_id":"training_dataset_eight_hundred-adi"}
